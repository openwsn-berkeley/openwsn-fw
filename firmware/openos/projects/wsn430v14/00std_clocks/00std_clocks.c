/**
\brief This is a standalone test program for the clocks on the TelosB
       board.

Download the program to a TelosB board, run it. It will output its
clocks on the pins below. Note that these pins are connected to the
LEDs, so they will blink (so fast they will appear simply on to your slow eyes).
Use a scope probe to see the clock signals and measure their frequency.

The digital outputs are:
   - P5.4: MCLK  (red LED or pad 48 on the back)
   - P5.5: SMCLK (green LED or pad 49 on the back)
   - P5.6: ACLK  (blue LED)
