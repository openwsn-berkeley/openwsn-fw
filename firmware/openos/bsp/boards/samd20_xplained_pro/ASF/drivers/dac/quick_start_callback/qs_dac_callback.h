/**
 * \page asfdoc_sam0_dac_basic_use_case_callback Quick Start Guide for DAC - Callback
 *
 * In this use case, the DAC will be convert 16 samples using interrupt driven conversion.
 * When all samples have been sampled, a callback will be called that signals the main
 * application that conversion is compete.
 *
 * The DAC will be set up as follows:
 * - Analog VCC as reference
 * - Internal output disabled
 * - Drive the DAC output to the V<sub>OUT</sub> pin
 * - Right adjust data
 * - The output buffer is disabled when the chip enters STANDBY sleep mode
 * - DAC conversion is started with RTC overflow event
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_dac_callback_basic_use_case_callback_setup Setup
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_dac_callback_basic_use_case_prereq Prerequisites
 * There are no special setup requirements for this use-case.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_dac_callback_basic_use_case_callback_code Code
 * Add to the main application source file, outside of any functions:
 * \snippet qs_dac_callback.c transfer_length
 * \snippet qs_dac_callback.c dac_module_inst
 * \snippet qs_dac_callback.c rtc_module_inst
 * \snippet qs_dac_callback.c event_res

 * \snippet qs_dac_callback.c dac_data
 *
 * Callback function:
 * \snippet qs_dac_callback.c job_complete_callback
 *
 * Copy-paste the following setup code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_dac_callback.c setup_rtc
 * \snippet qs_dac_callback.c setup_dac
 * \snippet qs_dac_callback.c setup_dac_channel
 *
 * define a  data length variables and add to user application (typically the start of \c main()):
 * \snippet qs_dac_callback.c data_length_var
 *
 * Add to user application initialization (typically the start of \c main()):
 * \snippet qs_dac_callback.c setup_init
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_dac_basic_use_case_callback_workflow Workflow
 * -# Create a module software instance structure for the DAC module to store
 *    the DAC driver state while it is in use.
 *    \snippet qs_dac_callback.c dac_module_inst
 *    \note This should never go out of scope as long as the module is in use.
 *          In most cases, this should be global.
 *
 * -# RTC module is used as the event trigger for DAC in this case, create a module
 *    software instance structure for the RTC module to store the RTC driver state.
 *    \snippet qs_dac_callback.c rtc_module_inst
 *    \note This should never go out of scope as long as the module is in use.
 *          In most cases, this should be global.
 *
 * -# Create a buffer for the DAC samples to be converted by the driver.
 *    \snippet qs_dac_callback.c dac_data
