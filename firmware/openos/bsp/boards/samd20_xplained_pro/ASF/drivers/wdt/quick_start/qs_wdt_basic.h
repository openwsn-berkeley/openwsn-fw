/**
 * \page asfdoc_sam0_wdt_basic_use_case Quick Start Guide for WDT - Basic
 *
 * In this use case, the Watchdog module is configured for:
 *  \li System reset after 2048 clocks of the Watchdog generic clock
 *  \li Always on mode disabled
 *  \li Basic mode, with no window or early warning periods
 *
 * This use case sets up the Watchdog to force a system reset after every 2048
 * clocks of the Watchdog's Generic Clock channel, unless the user periodically
 * resets the Watchdog counter via a button before the timer expires. If the
 * watchdog resets the device, a LED on the board is turned off.
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_wdt_basic_use_case_setup Setup
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_wdt_basic_use_case_setup_prereq Prerequisites
 * There are no special setup requirements for this use-case.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_wdt_basic_use_case_setup_code Code
 * Copy-paste the following setup code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_wdt_basic.c setup
 *
 * Add to user application initialization (typically the start of \c main()):
 * \snippet qs_wdt_basic.c setup_init
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_wdt_basic_use_case_setup_flow Workflow
 * -# Create a Watchdog module configuration struct, which can be filled out to
 *    adjust the configuration of the Watchdog.
 *    \snippet qs_wdt_basic.c setup_1
 * -# Initialize the Watchdog configuration struct with the module's default
 *    values.
 *    \snippet qs_wdt_basic.c setup_2
 *    \note This should always be performed before using the configuration
 *          struct to ensure that all values are initialized to known default
 *          settings.
 *
 * -# Adjust the configuration struct to set the timeout period and lock mode
 *    of the Watchdog.
 *    \snippet qs_wdt_basic.c setup_3
 * -# Setups the WDT hardware module with the requested settings.
 *    \snippet qs_wdt_basic.c setup_4
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_wdt_basic_use_case Use Case
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_wdt_basic_use_case_code Code
 * Copy-paste the following code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_wdt_basic.c main
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_wdt_basic_use_case_main Workflow
 * -# Retrieve the cause of the system reset to determine if the watchdog module
 *    was the cause of the last reset.
 *    \snippet qs_wdt_basic.c main_1
 * -# Turn on or off the board LED based on whether the watchdog reset the device.
 *    \snippet qs_wdt_basic.c main_2
 * -# Enter an infinite loop to hold the main program logic.
 *    \snippet qs_wdt_basic.c main_3
 * -# Test to see if the board button is currently being pressed.
 *    \snippet qs_wdt_basic.c main_4
 * -# If the button is pressed, turn on the board LED and reset the Watchdog
 *    timer.
 *    \snippet qs_wdt_basic.c main_5
