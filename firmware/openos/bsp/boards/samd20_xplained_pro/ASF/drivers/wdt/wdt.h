/**
 * \defgroup asfdoc_sam0_wdt_group SAM D20/D21/R21 Watchdog Driver (WDT)
 *
 * This driver for SAM D20/D21/R21 devices provides an interface for the configuration
 * and management of the device's Watchdog Timer module, including the enabling,
 * disabling and kicking within the device. The following driver API modes are
 * covered by this manual:
 *
 *  - Polled APIs
 * \if WDT_CALLBACK_MODE
 *  - Callback APIs
 * \endif
 *
 * The following peripherals are used by this module:
 *
 *  - WDT (Watchdog Timer)
 *
 * The outline of this documentation is as follows:
 *  - \ref asfdoc_sam0_wdt_prerequisites
 *  - \ref asfdoc_sam0_wdt_module_overview
 *  - \ref asfdoc_sam0_wdt_special_considerations
 *  - \ref asfdoc_sam0_wdt_extra_info
 *  - \ref asfdoc_sam0_wdt_examples
 *  - \ref asfdoc_sam0_wdt_api_overview
 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_wdt_prerequisites Prerequisites
 *
 * There are no prerequisites for this module.
 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_wdt_module_overview Module Overview
 *
 * The Watchdog module (WDT) is designed to give an added level of safety in
 * critical systems, to ensure a system reset is triggered in the case of a
 * deadlock or other software malfunction that prevents normal device operation.
 *
 * At a basic level, the Watchdog is a system timer with a fixed period; once
 * enabled, it will continue to count ticks of its asynchronous clock until
 * it is periodically reset, or the timeout period is reached. In the event of a
 * Watchdog timeout, the module will trigger a system reset identical to a pulse
 * of the device's reset pin, resetting all peripherals to their power-on
 * default states and restarting the application software from the reset vector.
 *
 * In many systems, there is an obvious upper bound to the amount of time each
 * iteration of the main application loop can be expected to run, before a
 * malfunction can be assumed (either due to a deadlock waiting on hardware or
 * software, or due to other means). When the Watchdog is configured with a
 * timeout period equal to this upper bound, a malfunction in the system will
 * force a full system reset to allow for a graceful recovery.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_wdt_module_locked_mode Locked Mode
 * The Watchdog configuration can be set in the device fuses and locked in
 * hardware, so that no software changes can be made to the Watchdog
 * configuration. Additionally, the Watchdog can be locked on in software if it
 * is not already locked, so that the module configuration cannot be modified
 * until a power on reset of the device.
 *
 * The locked configuration can be used to ensure that faulty software does not
 * cause the Watchdog configuration to be changed, preserving the level of
 * safety given by the module.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_wdt_module_window_mode Window Mode
 * Just as there is a reasonable upper bound to the time the main program loop
 * should take for each iteration, there is also in many applications a lower
 * bound, i.e. a \a minimum time for which each loop iteration should run for
 * under normal circumstances. To guard against a system failure resetting the
 * Watchdog in a tight loop (or a failure in the system application causing the
 * main loop to run faster than expected) a "Window" mode can be enabled to
 * disallow resetting of the Watchdog counter before a certain period of time.
 * If the Watchdog is not reset \a after the window opens but not \a before the
 * Watchdog expires, the system will reset.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_wdt_module_early_warning Early Warning
 * In some cases it is desirable to receive an early warning that the Watchdog is
 * about to expire, so that some system action (such as saving any system
 * configuration data for failure analysis purposes) can be performed before the
 * system reset occurs. The Early Warning feature of the Watchdog module allows
 * such a notification to be requested; after the configured early warning time
 * (but before the expiry of the Watchdog counter) the Early Warning flag will
 * become set, so that the user application can take an appropriate action.
 *
 * \note It is important to note that the purpose of the Early Warning feature
 *       is \a not to allow the user application to reset the Watchdog; doing
 *       so will defeat the safety the module gives to the user application.
 *       Instead, this feature should be used purely to perform any tasks that
 *       need to be undertaken before the system reset occurs.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_wdt_module_overview_physical Physical Connection
 *
 * \ref asfdoc_sam0_wdt_module_int_connections "The figure below" shows how
 * this module is interconnected within the device.

 * }
 * \enddot
 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_wdt_special_considerations Special Considerations
 *
 * On some devices the Watchdog configuration can be fused to be always on in
 * a particular configuration; if this mode is enabled the Watchdog is not
 * software configurable and can have its count reset and early warning state
 * checked/cleared only.
