 * \page asfdoc_sam0_pac_basic_use_case Quick Start Guide for PAC - Basic
 *
 * In this use case, the peripheral-lock will be used to lock and unlock the
 * PORT peripheral access, and show how to implement the PAC module when the
 * PORT registers needs to be altered. The PORT will be set up as follows:
 * - One pin in input mode, with pull-up and falling edge-detect.
 * - One pin in output mode.
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_pac_basic_use_case_setup Setup
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_pac_basic_use_case_setup_prereq Prerequisites
 * There are no special setup requirements for this use-case.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_pac_basic_use_case_setup_code Code
 * Copy-paste the following setup code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_pac_basic.c pin_setup
 *
 * Add to user application initialization (typically the start of \c main()):
 * \snippet qs_pac_basic.c init
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_pac_basic_use_case_use_main Use Case
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_pac_basic_use_case_code Code
 * Copy-paste the following code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_pac_basic.c main
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_pac_basic_use_case_flow Workflow
 * -# Configure some GPIO port pins for input and output.
 *    \snippet qs_pac_basic.c init
 * -# Lock peripheral access for the PORT module; attempting to update the
 *    module while it is in a protected state will cause a Hard Fault exception.
 *    \snippet qs_pac_basic.c init_lock
 * -# Enable global interrupts.
 *    \snippet qs_pac_basic.c enable_interrupts
 * -# Loop to wait for a button press before continuing.
 *    \snippet qs_pac_basic.c button_press
 * -# Enter a critical section, so that the PAC module can be unlocked safely
 *    and the peripheral manipulated without the possibility of an interrupt
 *    modifying the protected module's state.
 *    \snippet qs_pac_basic.c disable_interrupts
 * -# Unlock the PORT peripheral registers.
 *    \snippet qs_pac_basic.c unlock_perph
 * -# Toggle pin 11, and clear edge detect flag.
 *    \snippet qs_pac_basic.c alter_config
 * -# Lock the PORT peripheral registers.
 *    \snippet qs_pac_basic.c lock_perph
 * -# Exit the critical section to allow interrupts to function normally again.
 *    \snippet qs_pac_basic.c enable_interrupts_2
 * -# Enter an infinite while loop once the module state has been modified
 *    successfully.
 *    \snippet qs_pac_basic.c inf_loop
