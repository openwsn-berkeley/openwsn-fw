/**
 * \page asfdoc_sam0_events_basic_use_case Quick Start Guide for EVENTS - Basic
 *
 * In this use case, the EVENT module is configured for:
 *  \li Synchronous event path with rising edge detection on the input
 *  \li One user attached to the configured event channel
 *  \li No hardware event generator attached to the channel
 *
 * This use case allocates an event channel, this channel is not connected to any
 * hardware event generator, events are software triggered. One user is connected
 * to the allocated and configured event channel.
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_events_basic_use_case_setup Setup
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_events_basic_use_casesetup_prereq Prerequisites
 * There are no special setup requirements for this use-case.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_events_basic_use_casesetup_code Code
 * Copy-paste the following setup code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_events_basic.c setup
 *
 *
 * Create an event resource struct and add to user application (typically the start of \c main()):
 * \snippet qs_events_basic.c events_resource_struct
 *
 * Add to user application initialization (typically the start of \c main()):
 * \snippet qs_events_basic.c setup_init
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_events_basic_use_casesetup_flow Workflow
 * -# Create an event channel configuration struct, which can be filled out to
 *    adjust the configuration of a single event channel.
 *    \snippet qs_events_basic.c setup_1
 *    \br
 *
 * -# Initialize the event channel configuration struct with the module's
 *    default values.
 *    \snippet qs_events_basic.c setup_2
 *    \note This should always be performed before using the configuration
 *          struct to ensure that all values are initialized to known default
 *          settings.
 *
 * -# Adjust the configuration struct to request that the channel be attached
 *    to the specified event generator, that rising edges of the event signal
 *    be detected on the channel and that the synchronous event path be used.
 *    \snippet qs_events_basic.c setup_3
 *    \br
 *
 * -# Allocate and configure the channel using the configuration structure.
 *    \snippet qs_events_basic.c setup_4
 *    \note The existing configuration struct may be re-used, as long as any
 *          values that have been altered from the default settings are taken
 *          into account by the user application.
 *
 * -# Attach an user to the channel
 *    \snippet qs_events_basic.c setup_5
 *    \br
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_events_basic_use_case_main Use Case
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_events_basic_use_casecode_code Code
 * Copy-paste the following code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_events_basic.c main
 *
 * \subsection events_basic_use_case_code_flow Workflow
 * -# Wait for the even channel to become ready to accept a new event trigger.
 *    \snippet qs_events_basic.c main_1
 * -# Perform a software event trigger on the configured event channel.
 *    \snippet qs_events_basic.c main_2
