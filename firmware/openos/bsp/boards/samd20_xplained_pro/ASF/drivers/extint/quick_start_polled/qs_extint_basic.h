/**
 * \page asfdoc_sam0_extint_basic_use_case Quick Start Guide for EXTINT - Basic
 *
 * In this use case, the EXTINT module is configured for:
 *  - External interrupt channel connected to the board LED is used
 *  - External interrupt channel is configured to detect both input signal edges
 *
 * This use case configures a physical I/O pin of the device so that it is
 * routed to a logical External Interrupt Controller channel to detect rising
 * and falling edges of the incoming signal.
 *
 * When the board button is pressed, the board LED will light up. When the board
 * button is released, the LED will turn off.
 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_extint_basic_use_case_setup Setup
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_extint_basic_use_case_setup_prereq Prerequisites
 * There are no special setup requirements for this use-case.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_extint_basic_use_case_setup_code Code
 * Copy-paste the following setup code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_extint_basic.c setup
 *
 * Add to user application initialization (typically the start of \c main()):
 * \snippet qs_extint_basic.c setup_init
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_extint_basic_use_case_setup_flow Workflow
 * -# Create an EXTINT module channel configuration struct, which can be filled
 *    out to adjust the configuration of a single external interrupt channel.
 *    \snippet qs_extint_basic.c setup_1
 * -# Initialize the channel configuration struct with the module's default
 *    values.
 *    \snippet qs_extint_basic.c setup_2
 *    \note This should always be performed before using the configuration
 *          struct to ensure that all values are initialized to known default
 *          settings.
 *
 * -# Adjust the configuration struct to configure the pin MUX (to route the
 *    desired physical pin to the logical channel) to the board button, and to
 *    configure the channel to detect both rising and falling edges.
 *    \snippet qs_extint_basic.c setup_3
 * -# Configure external interrupt channel with the desired channel settings.
 *    \snippet qs_extint_basic.c setup_4
 *
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_extint_basic_use_case_main Use Case
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_extint_basic_use_case_main_code Code
 * Copy-paste the following code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_extint_basic.c main
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_extint_basic_use_case_main_flow Workflow
 * -# Read in the current external interrupt channel state to see if an edge
 *    has been detected.
 *    \snippet qs_extint_basic.c main_1
 * -# Read in the new physical button state and mirror it on the board LED.
 *    \snippet qs_extint_basic.c main_2
 * -# Clear the detection state of the external interrupt channel so that it
 *    is ready to detect a future falling edge.
 *    \snippet qs_extint_basic.c main_3
