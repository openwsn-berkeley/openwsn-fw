/**
 * \page asfdoc_sam0_adc_basic_use_case Quick Start Guide for ADC - Basic
 *
 * In this use case, the ADC will be configured with the following settings:
 * - 1V from internal bandgap reference
 * - Div 4 clock prescaler
 * - 12 bit resolution
 * - Window monitor disabled
 * - No gain
 * - Positive input on ADC PIN 0
 * - Negative input on ADC PIN 1
 * - Averaging disabled
 * - Oversampling disabled
 * - Right adjust data
 * - Single-ended mode
 * - Free running disabled
 * - All events (input and generation) disabled
 * - Sleep operation disabled
 * - No reference compensation
 * - No gain/offset correction
 * - No added sampling time
 * - Pin scan mode disabled
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_adc_basic_use_case_setup Setup
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_adc_basic_use_case_prereq Prerequisites
 * There are no special setup requirements for this use-case.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_adc_basic_use_case_code Code
 * Add to the main application source file, outside of any functions:
 * \snippet qs_adc_basic.c module_inst
 *
 * Copy-paste the following setup code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_adc_basic.c setup
 *
 * Add to user application initialization (typically the start of \c main()):
 * \snippet qs_adc_basic.c setup_init
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_adc_basic_use_case_workflow Workflow
 * -# Create a module software instance structure for the ADC module to store
 *    the ADC driver state while it is in use.
 *    \snippet qs_adc_basic.c module_inst
 *    \note This should never go out of scope as long as the module is in use.
 *          In most cases, this should be global.
 *
 * -# Configure the ADC module.
 *  -# Create a ADC module configuration struct, which can be filled out to
 *     adjust the configuration of a physical ADC peripheral.
 *     \snippet qs_adc_basic.c setup_config
 *  -# Initialize the ADC configuration struct with the module's default values.
 *     \snippet qs_adc_basic.c setup_config_defaults
 *     \note This should always be performed before using the configuration
 *           struct to ensure that all values are initialized to known default
 *           settings.
 *
 *  -# Enable the ADC module so that conversions can be made.
 *     \snippet qs_adc_basic.c setup_enable
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_adc_basic_use_case_use Use Case
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_adc_basic_use_case_use_code Code
 * Copy-paste the following code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_adc_basic.c main
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_adc_basic_use_case_use_workflow Workflow
 *  -# Start conversion.
 *  \snippet qs_adc_basic.c start_conv
 *  -# Wait until conversion is done and read result.
 *  \snippet qs_adc_basic.c get_res
 *  -# Enter an infinite loop once the conversion is complete.
 *  \snippet qs_adc_basic.c inf_loop
