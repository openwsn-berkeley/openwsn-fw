/**
 * \page asfdoc_sam0_tc_dma_use_case Quick Start Guide for Using DMA with TC
 *
 * The supported device list:
 *    - SAM D21/R21
 *
 * In this use case, the TC will be used to generate a PWM signal. Here
 * the pulse width is set to one quarter of the period. Once the counter value
 * matches the values in the Compare/Capture Value register, a event will be
 * tiggered for a DMA memory to memory transfer.
 * The TC module will be set up as follows:
 *
 * \li GCLK generator 0 (GCLK main) clock source
 * \li 16 bit resolution on the counter
 * \li No prescaler
 * \li Normal PWM wave generation
 * \li GCLK reload action
 * \li Don't run in standby
 * \li No inversion of waveform output
 * \li No capture enabled
 * \li Count upward
 * \li Don't perform one-shot operations
 * \li No event input enabled
 * \li No event action
 * \li No event generation enabled
 * \li Counter starts on 0
 * \li Capture compare channel 0 set to 0xFFFF/4
 *
 * The DMA module is configured for:
 *  \li Move data from memory to memory
 *  \li Using peripheral trigger of TC6 Match/Compare 0
 *  \li Using DMA priority level 0

 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_tc_dma_use_case_prereq Prerequisites
 * There are no prerequisites for this use case.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_tc_dma_use_case_setup_code Code
 * Add to the main application source file, before any functions:
 * \snippet conf_quick_start.h definition_pwm
 * \snippet conf_quick_start.h definition_dma
 *
 * Add to the main application source file, outside of any functions:
 * \snippet qs_tc_dma.c module_inst
 * \snippet qs_tc_dma.c dma_resource
 * \snippet qs_tc_dma.c transfer_length
 * \snippet qs_tc_dma.c transfer_counter
 * \snippet qs_tc_dma.c source_memory
 * \snippet qs_tc_dma.c destination_memory
 * \snippet qs_tc_dma.c transfer_done_flag
 * \snippet qs_tc_dma.c example_descriptor
 *
 * Copy-paste the following setup code to your user application:
 * \snippet qs_tc_dma.c setup
 *
 * Add to user application initialization (typically the start of \c main()):
 * \snippet qs_tc_dma.c setup_init
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_tc_dma_use_case_setup_flow Workflow
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_sam0_tc_dma_use_case_setup_flow_inst Create variables
 * -# Create a module software instance structure for the TC module to store
 *    the TC driver state while it is in use.
 *    \snippet qs_tc_dma.c module_inst
 *    \note This should never go out of scope as long as the module is in use.
 *          In most cases, this should be global.
 *
 * -# Create a module software instance structure for DMA resource to store
 *    the DMA resource state while it is in use.
 *    \snippet qs_tc_dma.c dma_resource
 *    \note This should never go out of scope as long as the module is in use.
 *          In most cases, this should be global.
 *
 * \subsubsection asfdoc_sam0_tc_dma_use_case_setup_flow_tc Configure TC
 * -# Create a TC module configuration struct, which can be filled out to
 *    adjust the configuration of a physical TC peripheral.
 *    \snippet qs_tc_dma.c setup_config
 * -# Initialize the TC configuration struct with the module's default values.
 *    \snippet qs_tc_dma.c setup_config_defaults
 *    \note This should always be performed before using the configuration
 *          struct to ensure that all values are initialized to known default
 *          settings.

 *    mode and the compare channel 0 value.
