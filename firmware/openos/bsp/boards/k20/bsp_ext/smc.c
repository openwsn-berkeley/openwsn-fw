/*
 * File:        smc.c
 * Purpose:     Provides routines for entering low power modes.
 *
 * Notes:	Since the wakeup mechanism for low power modes
 *              will be application specific, these routines
 *              do not include code to setup interrupts to exit
 *              from the low power modes. The desired means of
 *              low power mode exit should be configured before
 *              calling any of these functions.
 *
 *              These routines do not include protection to
 *              prevent illegal state transitions in the mode
 *              controller, and all routines that write to the
 *              PMPROT register write a value to allow all
 *              possible low power modes (it is write once, so
 *              if only the currently requested mode is enabled
 *              a different mode couldn't be enabled later on).
 *

/* WAIT mode entry routine. Puts the processor into wait mode.
 * In this mode the core clock is disabled (no code executing), but 
 * bus clocks are enabled (peripheral modules are operational). 
 *
 * Mode transitions:
 * RUN -> WAIT
 * VLPR -> VLPW
 *
 * This function can be used to enter normal wait mode or VLPW
 * mode. If you are executing in normal run mode when calling this
 * function, then you will enter normal wait mode. If you are in VLPR
 * mode when calling this function, then you will enter VLPW mode instead.
 *
 * NOTE: Some modules include a programmable option to disable them in 
 * wait mode. If those modules are programmed to disable in wait mode, 
 * they will not be able to generate interrupts to wake up the core.
 *
 * WAIT mode is exited using any enabled interrupt or RESET, so no
 * exit_wait routine is needed. 
 *
* If in VLPW mode, the statue of the SMC_PMCTRL[LPWUI] bit determines if 
 * the processor exits to VLPR (LPWUI cleared) or normal run mode (LPWUI 
 * set). The enable_lpwui() and disable_lpwui()functions can be used to set
 * this bit to the desired option prior to calling enter_wait().

 * Parameters:
