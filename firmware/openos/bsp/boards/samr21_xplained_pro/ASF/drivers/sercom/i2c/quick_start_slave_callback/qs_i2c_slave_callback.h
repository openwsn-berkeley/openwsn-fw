/**
 * \page asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_slave_callback_use_case Quick Start Guide for SERCOM I2C Slave - Callback
 *
 * In this use case, the I<SUP>2</SUP>C will used and set up as follows:
 *  - Slave mode
 *  - 100kHz operation speed
 *  - Not operational in standby
 *  - 10000 packet timeout value
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_slave_callback_use_case_prereq Prerequisites
 * The device must be connected to an I<SUP>2</SUP>C master.
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_slave_callback_use_case_setup_code Setup
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_slave_callback_use_setup_code Code
 * The following must be added to the user application:
 *
 * A sample buffer to write from, a sample buffer to read to and length of buffers:
 * \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c packet_data
 *
 * Address to respond to:
 * \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c address
 *
 * Globally accessible module structure:
 * \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c module
 *
 * Globally accessible packet:
 * \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c packet
 *
 * Function for setting up the module.
 * \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c initialize_i2c
 *
 * Callback function for read request from a master:
 * \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c read_request
 *
 * Callback function for write request from a master:
 * \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c write_request
 *
 * Function for setting up the callback functionality of the driver:
 * \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c setup_i2c_callback
 *
 * Add to user application main():
 * \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c run_initialize_i2c
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_slave_callback_use_setup_workflow Workflow
 * -# Configure and enable module:
 *    \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c config
 *   -# Create and initialize configuration structure.
 *      \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c init_conf
 *   -# Change address and address mode settings in the configuration.
 *      \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c conf_changes
 *   -# Initialize the module with the set configurations.
 *      \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c init_module
 *   -# Enable the module.
 *      \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c enable_module
 * -# Register and enable callback functions.
 *    \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c config_callback
 *   -# Register and enable callbacks for read and write requests from master.
 *      \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c reg_en_i2c_callback
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_slave_callback_use_implementation Implementation
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_slave_callback_use_implementation_code Code
 * Add to user application main:
 * \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c while
 * \subsection i2c_slave_callback_use_implementation_workflow Workflow
 * -# Infinite while loop, while waiting for interaction from master.
 *    \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c while
 *
 * \section asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_slave_callback_use_callback Callback
 * When an address packet is received, one of the callback functions will be
  * called, depending on the DIR bit in the received packet.
 *
 * \subsection asfdoc_sam0_sercom_i2c_slave_callback_use_callback_workflow Workflow
 * - Read request callback:
 *  -# Length of buffer and buffer to be sent to master is initialized.
 *     \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c packet_write
 *  -# Write packet to master.
 *     \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c write_packet
 *
 * - Write request callback:
 *  -# Length of buffer and buffer to be read from master is initialized.
 *     \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c packet_read
 *  -# Read packet from master.
 *     \snippet qs_i2c_slave_callback.c read_packet
