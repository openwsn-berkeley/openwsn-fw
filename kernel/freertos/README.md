FreeRTOS is a full-featured preemtive task scheduler developed by Real Time Engineers Ltd (NOT the OpenWSN team) and available at http://www.freertos.org/.

In accordance with the FreeRTOS licensing model, we are including it in unmodified source code.

This directory can contain several directories, one for each version of FreeRTOS used. Because the downloaded version of FreeRTOS contains many files, we have removed all the unused files and folders, while keeping the directory structure, so we can easily upgrade to future revisions of FreeRTOS.
