`openos` is a simple run-to-completion non-preemtive task scheduler developed by the OpenWSN team.

While it does not offer all the features of an RTOS such as FreeRTOS (http://www.freertos.org/), in particular preemtion, it is also less memory-hungry since it is single-threaded.

Because of its simplicity and applicability to very RAM-constrained devices, the openos kernel is maintained alongside more full-featured RTOS kernels.
