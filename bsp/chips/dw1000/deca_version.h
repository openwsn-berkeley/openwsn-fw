//
// The DW1000 device driver is separately version numbered to any version the application using it may have
//
// Two symbols are defined here: one hexadecimal value and one string that includes the hex bytes.
// Both should be updated together in a consistent way when the software is being modified.
//
// The format of the hex version is 0xAABBCC and the string ends with AA.BB.CC, where...
//
// Quantity CC is updated for minor changes/bug fixes that should not need user code changes
// Quantity BB is updated for changes/bug fixes that may need user code changes
// Quantity AA is updated for major changes that will need user code changes
//
