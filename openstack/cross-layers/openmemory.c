/**
 * \brief Declaration of the "openmemory" interface.
 *
 * Implements a very simple memory manager.
 * How it works:
 * Memory is segmented in blocks of the FRAME_DATA_TOTAL (130B) size.
 * It uses two arrays to manage how memory is used
 *  - buffer, the memory array
 *  - map, an occupation array
 * The map array contains zero if segment is not assigned or a positive
 * value. This number indicates how many segments are asigned, including
 * itself, to start. Example: next is a 10 segments map; starting addresses
 * correspond to: 0, 130, 260, 390, 520, 650, 780, 910, 1040 and 1170
 * +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 * | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
 * +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
 *   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
 * - Position 9 contains 1: memory area from byte 1170 is reserved
 * - Position 8 contains 1: reserved from byte 1040 to 1169
 * - Position 7 contains 0: free     from byte  910 to 1039
 * - Position 6 contains 1: reserved from byte  780 to  909
 * - Position 5 contains 3: reserved from byte  390 to  779
 * - Segments 0, 1 and 2 are free:   from byte    0 to  389
 *
 * It does not include control mechanisms for overlapping, fragmentation
 * or other possible errors.
